# NCBS_StatGenomics_Workshop
This short project was carried out as part of a NCBS-2025 Statistical Genomics workshop, applying data-driven methods and performing pan-cancer analysis of diverse mutational signatures from PCAWG and HMF WGS datasets and used statistical models to characterize genome instability across tumor types.
